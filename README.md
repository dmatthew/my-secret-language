# My Secret Language

Create your own secret language!

A single page JavaScript application built with [React](https://reactjs.org) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The My Secret Language app uses the Local Storage API for storing your dictionary of words. It uses function components and React hooks.

See the app in action at [my-secret-language.vercel.app](https://my-secret-language.vercel.app/).

## Features of the app:

- Add, edit, and delete new words.
- Translate sentences from your native language into your secret language.
- View all your words in your own language's dictionary.
- Study your own secret language by using the app's flashcards feature.

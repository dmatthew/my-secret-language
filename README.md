My Secret Language
==================

Create your own secret language!

Built with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) v1.2 and Intel's UI [App Framework](https://github.com/intel/appframework). The My Secret Language app uses the Local Storage API so users can use the app anywhere, even offline.

**UPDATE: I am currently rebuilding this app with React. See the work in progress code on the [react](https://github.com/dmatthew/my-secret-language/tree/react) branch.**

### Features of the app:

* Add, edit, and delete new words.
* Translate sentences from English into your secret language.
* View all your words in your own language's dictionary.
* Study your own secret language by using the app's flashcards feature.
* Can be used offline when you don't have an internet connection.
